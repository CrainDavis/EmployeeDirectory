## Description:
This application, upon page load, displays employee data generated from the [Random User Generator API](https://randomuser.me/). Users can then do two things with this data:
* sort various categories (first name, last name, date of birth, username, or location) in ascending or descending order
* filter employees by one of three ways (full name, location, or username)

This application demonstrates the use of _ReactJS_, as well as _React Hooks_ (_useState_, _useEffect_) and _Context_, and is __front-end__ only.

## Usage:
To use this application, go to __[this link](https://craindavis.github.io/EmployeeDirectory/)__. (Also, please blame [GIPHY](https://giphy.com/) for the quality of the GIFs seen below...)

Upon opening the page in the browser, the page will automatically display data for 200 employees.

![gif 1](readme/gif-1.gif)

The data can be sorted in ascending/descending order based on the following categories:
* first name
* last name
* username
* date of birth
* location (city)

![gif 2](readme/gif-2.gif)

This data can also be filtered so that only profiles that meet a specification are displayed to the user. Employees can be searched for by the following input:
* first or last name
* location (city or state)
* username

Our Pledge
We as members, contributors, and leaders pledge to make participation in our

identity and expression, level of experience, education, socio-economic status,
nationality, personal appearance, race, religion, or sexual identity
and orientation.
We pledge to act and interact in ways that contribute to an open, welcoming,
diverse, inclusive, and healthy community.
Our Standards
Examples of behavior that contributes to a positive environment for our
community include:

* Demonstrating empathy and kindness toward other people
* Being respectful of differing opinions, viewpoints, and experiences
* Giving and gracefully accepting constructive feedback
* Accepting responsibility and apologizing to those affected by our mistakes,
and learning from the experience
* Focusing on what is best not just for us as individuals, but for the
overall community

Examples of unacceptable behavior include:

advances of any kind
* Trolling, insulting or derogatory comments, and personal or political attacks
* Public or private harassment
* Publishing others’ private information, such as a physical or email
address, without their explicit permission
* Other conduct which could reasonably be considered inappropriate in a
professional setting

Enforcement Responsibilities
Community leaders are responsible for clarifying and enforcing our standards of
acceptable behavior and will take appropriate and fair corrective action in
response to any behavior that they deem inappropriate, threatening, offensive,
or harmful.
Community leaders have the right and responsibility to remove, edit, or reject
comments, commits, code, wiki edits, issues, and other contributions that are
not aligned to this Code of Conduct, and will communicate reasons for moderation
decisions when appropriate.
Scope
This Code of Conduct applies within all community spaces, and also applies when
an individual is officially representing the community in public spaces.
Examples of representing our community include using an official e-mail address,
posting via an official social media account, or acting as an appointed
representative at an online or offline event.
Enforcement
Instances of abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behavior may be
reported to the community leaders responsible for enforcement at
[INSERT CONTACT METHOD].
All complaints will be reviewed and investigated promptly and fairly.
All community leaders are obligated to respect the privacy and security of the
reporter of any incident.
Enforcement Guidelines
Community leaders will follow these Community Impact Guidelines in determining
the consequences for any action they deem in violation of this Code of Conduct:
1. Correction
Community Impact: Use of inappropriate language or other behavior deemed
unprofessional or unwelcome in the community.
Consequence: A private, written warning from community leaders, providing
clarity around the nature of the violation and an explanation of why the
behavior was inappropriate. A public apology may be requested.
2. Warning
Community Impact: A violation through a single incident or series
of actions.
Consequence: A warning with consequences for continued behavior. No
interaction with the people involved, including unsolicited interaction with
those enforcing the Code of Conduct, for a specified period of time. This
includes avoiding interactions in community spaces as well as external channels
like social media. Violating these terms may lead to a temporary or
permanent ban.
3. Temporary Ban
Community Impact: A serious violation of community standards, including
sustained inappropriate behavior.
Consequence: A temporary ban from any sort of interaction or public
communication with the community for a specified period of time. No public or
private interaction with the people involved, including unsolicited interaction
with those enforcing the Code of Conduct, is allowed during this period.
Violating these terms may lead to a permanent ban.
4. Permanent Ban
Community Impact: Demonstrating a pattern of violation of community
standards, including sustained inappropriate behavior,  harassment of an
individual, or aggression toward or disparagement of classes of individuals.
Consequence: A permanent ban from any sort of public interaction within
the community.

## Future Development:
* __ISSUE 1:__ With the three input fields for filtering through data (full name, location, and username), a user can only use one field at a time to filter through employee data. If the user tries to use a second/third input field, the data will not filter through the already-filtered data. Instead, the subsequent filter inputs will re-filter through the original (full) dataset. Basically, inputting multiple filter parameters does not work, as only the user's _last_ input will be used to filter through employees.
  * __current (temporary) solution:__ If one input field is in use, the other two will become disabled.
  * __ideal solution:__ It would be nice if the user could search through the entire dataset using multiple filter parameters.
  * a failed attempt (problem: it does not take in the complete user input, and clearing the input does not undo the filtering; see branch `multiple-filter-function` for full code):

  ![img-1](readme/img-1.png)

* __ISSUE 2:__ The buttons to sort data do not indicate to the user whether clicking will sort in ascending or descending order.
  * __ideal solution:__ Each button should have some kind of icon (such as an up/down arrow) indicating whether the next click will arrange the dataset in ascending or descending order.
